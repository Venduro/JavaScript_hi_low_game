Hi/Lo Game Challenge
Create a function that plays the following game: The computer picks a secret random integer between 1 and 100 (both inclusive), and repeatedly asks the user for guesses.

If the users guess is too high or too low, the computer notifies them of that; and if the user guesses the secret number correctly, the computer displays a winning message and the game is over.

Stretch goal 1: If the user has not guessed the secret number in seven tries, the user loses.
Stretch goal 2: Validate the users input. If the user puts a anything other than a number, tell the user they can only use numbers.
Stretch goal 3: Allow the user to put there name in before the game starts. When the user has won the game, let the user know they have won, using their name.
